# Panic-PWA

A simple web app to play Panic At The Dojo. This contains all the required content for a player to get started and keep track of all their tokens during the game.

Feature wishlist (it'll be done when...):

- [x] State stored in URL
- [x] Visual UI pass (my eyes hurt)
- [ ] Director-side character sheets (Stooges, Warriors, and Bosses)
- [x] it's hosted somewhere semi-permanently
- [ ] ~Installable PWA~
