# Panic-PWA

A progressive web app for playing Panic At The Dojo (a combat-focused TTRPG).
I couldn't see many tools for this game, and the one that I've used so far is a google sheet.

*This is still heavily WIP.*

## MVP playable wishlist:
- A single page for everything a player needs to know:
  - tracking sheet for tokens, health, shields, etc.
  - basic actions list
  - current selected stance (or arch/style/form combo for frantic)
- add the rest of the game content for character options
- persist the sheet state (ideally in the url)
